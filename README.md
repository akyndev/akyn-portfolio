This is a [akyn-portfolio](https://https://github.com/akyndev/akyn-portfolio/) template built with [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

I used bun for this project though

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This template uses a custom font you can change it in the `app/font.ts`
